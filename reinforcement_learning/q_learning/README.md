# q-learning

## Description:

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a given state. It uses a Q-table to store the estimated values of each action-state pair, and updates them based on the observed rewards. Q-learning is an off-policy algorithm, meaning it can explore actions that are not part of the current policy. Q-learning aims to maximize the expected future rewards by finding the best series of actions in a Markov decision process.
